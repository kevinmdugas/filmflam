## Starting Doggr implementation
Now that things are mostly working, lets go ahead and start building our goal Doggr implementation.

Early on in internet history, we operated directly on HTML, and indeed HTML templating still exists.  However, modern dev has headed in the direction of offloading as much as possible into Frontend and leaving our backend to do only the required persistence.  This happens for a good reason - we don't pay for Frontend, since it runs on the user's computer instead of our server.

The downside is that rather than being a simple view rendering layer, as frontend was when servers did all the work, we now have effectively a backend-on-the-frontend, complete with routing and everything else our backend had that isn't directly interfacing with our postgres database

In Main.tsx, lets change it a bit to be clearer:
```ts
import React from 'react';  
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';  
import App from './App';  
import './index.css';  
  
const rootContainer: HTMLElement = document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement;  
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootContainer);  
root.render(  
  <React.StrictMode>  
    <App />  
  </React.StrictMode>  
)
```

- We'll also remove the template and start building our own Doggr
```ts
import './App.css';  
  
function App() {  
 return (  
  <div className="App">  
   <h1>Doggr</h1>  
  </div> );  
}  
  
export default App;
```

- Well also make a new Components.tsx file to hold our pieces, and make a Header for the site in it:
```ts
export const Header = () => {  
 return (<div>  
   <h1>Doggr</h1>  
   <h3>Where your pets finds love(tm)</h3>  
   <br />  </div> );  
}
```
and in app.tsx
```ts
import './App.css';  
import {Header} from "./Components";  
  
  
function App() {  
 return (  
  <div className="App">  
   <Header />  </div> );  
}  
  
export default App;
```

## Making actual request
Great, we have a basic-est page ever!  Lets try to build something a bit more useful and pertinent, a simple list of users from our backend (GET:/users)

For this we'll need our `state` from earlier, to hold the list of users, and also a new doodad called `useEffect` to talk to our backend.  To learn State, lets duplicate our earlier default example with a counter and a button via docs (https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/responding-to-events).  We can make ourselves a do-nothing button in Components

```ts
export const Button = () => {  
 return (  
  <button>  
   I am useless.
  </button>  
 );   
}
```

And add an onClick function to it as a parameter like this
```ts
export const Button = () => {  
 return (  
  <button onClick={() => {  
   alert("Clicked!");  
  }  
  }>  
   Click me!  
  </button>  
 );  
  
}
```

- Can trade alert for our old faithful console.log and see it in browser

### Now we're moving on to State. 
- Lets try naively adding a counter that counts up one each click:
```ts
export const Button = () => {  
 let clicks = 0;  
 return (  
  <button onClick={() => {  
   console.log("Clicked!");  
   clicks++;  
   console.log("Clicks is: ", clicks);  
  }  
  }>  
   Clicks: {clicks}  
  </button> );  
}
```

- Doesn't work bc React calls this WHOLE function on each rerender, so we are resetting our clicks every time!  Even worse, React won't even pay attention to changes in local variables, so it doesn't even update to show 1 click!  useState provides us solutions to BOTH of these at the same time:
```ts
export const Button = () => {  
 let [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);  
  
 return (  
  <button onClick={() => {     
   setClicks(clicks + 1);     
}  
  }>  
   Clicks: {clicks}  
  </button> );  
}
```

- As you can see, we no longer reset our clicks because we're storing them in the `clicks` field React is giving us.  We also no longer have to worry about React seeing the changes, because we MAKE those changes by "Pure"ly replacing the old value with the new using a special setter function React ALSO provides for us.  

# WARNING
```
**Hooks—functions starting with `use`—can only be called at the top level of your components or [your own Hooks.](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.
```

Think about the implications here for if we want to have multiple components use the same data.  Hint: That is what those ominous `props` things were in the React docs

## Code 7d35816

- OK so that covers state, now lets think about what all needs to happen to display our list of users:
	- make a place to store the users result returned from the backend (check)
	- get the data from the backend
	- show the data nicely to the browser
- Now we need to talk about that second one -- getting data from the backend.  We're going to use Axios to make a request that looks just like Postman or our backend testing injects!

`npm i axios`

- We want to make a GET request to our backend's /users when the page loads and only then.  
- We can also generate axios code directly from Postman!

```ts
const users = await axios.get(  
 "http://localhost:8080/users"  
);
```

That await presents a problem though.  We're not in procedural land anymore!  We're in declarative land, so we don't even have a concept of await here.  

-- TALK ABOUT DECLARATIVE VS PROCEDURAL

Instead, React will provide a handy-dandy place to put our async things, as well as any other functions that need to be re-executed ONLY WHEN some condition occurs.

This is what it looks like: 
```ts
const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);  
  
useEffect(() => {  
 const getUsers = async () => {  
  const users = await axios.get(  
   "http://localhost:8080/users"  
  );  
  setUsers(users.data);  
 };  
 getUsers();  
}, []);
```

This will run the effect function on page load, then NEVER AGAIN because `[]`.  Once it's done awaiting, it will call setUsers() from our state hook to update, which we use to render.  This makes our full code:

```ts
export const Users = () => {   
 const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);  
  
 useEffect(() => {  
  const getUsers = async () => {  
   const users = await axios.get(  
    "http://localhost:8080/users"  
   );  
   setUsers(users.data);  
  };  
  void getUsers();  
 }, []);  
  
 return (  
  <div>  
   <h2>Users:</h2>  
   {    users ?  
     <ul>{users.map((user: {email: string, name: string}) => <li key={user.email.toString()}>{user.name} - {user.email}</li>)}</ul>  
     : null  
   }  
  </div> );  
};
```

Finally we see information from our backend in the browser!  Our first trip is done.

Things to ponder:  
- What if MULTIPLE components need that same piece of state? 
- How in the world are we going to keep track of which components need to render and which don't? 

Lets set up basic "View profile, match or don't match, view another profile" loop.  This means our frontend needs a concept of overall "State".  We'll create a types subdir `/src/types/DoggrTypes.ts` and `initialState.ts`

```ts
export type State = {  
 currentProfile: ProfileType,  
 likeHistory: Array<ProfileType>,  
 passHistory: Array<ProfileType>,  
};  
  
export type ProfileType = {  
 imgUri: string,  
 thumbUri: string,  
 name: string,  
 id: number,  
}
```

```ts
  
import { State, ProfileType } from "./types/DoggrTypes";  
  
const initialState: { likeHistory: ProfileType[]; currentProfile: ProfileType } = {  
 currentProfile: getRandomProfile(),  
 likeHistory: [getRandomProfile(), getRandomProfile()],  
};  
  
export default initialState;  
  
export function getRandomProfile(): ProfileType {  
 const idNum = Math.random() * 10000;  
  
 return {  
  imgUri: `https://loremflickr.com/300/300/animal?lock=${idNum}`,  
  thumbUri: `https://loremflickr.com/75/75/animal?lock=${idNum}`,  
  name: `Doggr${idNum}`,  
  id: idNum,  
 };  
}
```

To make use of this, we're going to first alter the current App.tsx to change the "Converter" to Match, likethe following:

```ts
import './App.css'  
import { Link, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';  
import Home from './components/Home';  
import Match from './components/Match';  
  
function App() {  
    return (  
        <div className="App">  
            <nav>                <div className="menu">  
                    <Link to="/">Home</Link>  
                    <Link to="/match">Match</Link>  
                </div>            </nav>            <Routes>                <Route path="/match" element={<Match />} />  
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />  
            </Routes>        </div>    )  
}  
  
export default App
```

-- Then run rename refactor on components/Converter to Match.  We'll come back to match in a second, but first we'll finish up Home.tsx, which was already provided for us!  You can probably already see what this code does, but we're creating navigation between "pages".  

This is built into react in the form of react-router-dom and is what people mean when they say `Single Page App` -- we don't actually show any different pages at all, here!  We have just our ONE html file that does nothing but hook up React, then load our React App!  We thus must simulate what users "expect" using a router on our frontend too, JUST like the backend!  

https://reactrouter.com/en/main (We're using BrowserRouter from main.tsx)

** Now, inside of Home.tsx, we can create a little landing page:
```ts
export default function Home() {  
    return (<div>  
        <h1>Doggr</h1>  
        <h3>Where your pets finds love(tm)</h3>  
  
      </div>    );  
  }
```

Just to emphasize composability, lets convert this into multiple Components:

```ts
export default function Home() {  
    return (<div>  
        <Title />          <Subtitle />  
      </div>    );  
  }  
  
export function Title() {  
    return(<h1>Doggr</h1>)  
}  
  
export function Subtitle() {  
    return(<h3>Where your pets find love(tm)</h3>)  
}
```

How easy, right?
(## CODE 4a4b2f8f7cbfe9dbea6e7cf846e7f5f9bb6bdec1)

Now we're ready to move back to showing a Match list of profiles!  We have a Match already, now need to create a `Profile.tsx` in src/components/

In backend, our state comes from our database connection.  In frontend, we don't have (direct) access, so we have to manage our own.  We've already seen simple useState() above, but what happens if we want to access the same piece of State from more than one component?

This is where our second React concept comes from.  It piggybacks on html properties and allows you to pass State/data/ EVEN FUNCTIONS from a parent component to subcomponents!  So ANY time you need to share state, some upper parent component will be the one to useState() create and "own" it.  We're going to make a Profile Component that accepts some of its state from a parent:

```ts
import {useEffect} from "react";  
  
export type ProfileProps = {  
 id: number,  
 imgUri: string,  
 name: string,  
 onLikeButtonClick: () => void,  
 onPassButtonClick: () => void,  
}  
  
export function Profile(props: ProfileProps) {  
 let { imgUri, name, onLikeButtonClick, onPassButtonClick } = props;  
  
 useEffect(() => {  
  console.log("Profile rerendered");  
 });  
  
 return (  
  <div>  
   <img src={imgUri} alt="Profile of pet"/>  
   <h2>{name}</h2>  
   <div>    <button onClick={onPassButtonClick}>Pass</button>  
    <button onClick={onLikeButtonClick}>Like</button>  
   </div>  </div> );  
}
```

Now lets see the flipside where we utilize it before we talk about them together:

We're going to head to Match.tsx and add the following:

```ts
import {useEffect, useState} from 'react';  
import initialState, {getRandomProfile} from "../initialState";  
import {Profile} from "./Profile";  
import {Title} from "./Home";  
  
function Match() {  
    let [currentProfile, setCurrentProfile] = useState(initialState.currentProfile);  
    let [likeHistory, setLikeHistory] = useState(initialState.likeHistory);  
  
    useEffect(() => {  
        console.log("-- App rerenders --");  
    });  
  
    let onLikeButtonClick = () => {  
        // this keeps allocations and copies to a minimum  
        let newLikeHistory = [...likeHistory, currentProfile];  
        let newProfile = getRandomProfile();  
        setCurrentProfile(newProfile);  
        setLikeHistory(newLikeHistory);  
    };  
  
    let onPassButtonClick = () => {  
        let newCurrentProfile = getRandomProfile();  
        setCurrentProfile(newCurrentProfile);  
    };  
  
    let profile = <Profile {...currentProfile}  
                           onLikeButtonClick={onLikeButtonClick}  
                           onPassButtonClick={onPassButtonClick} />  
  
    return (  
      <>  
          <Title />          {profile}  
      </>    );  
}  
  
export default Match;
```

And we're now a multiple "page" SPA!  The next step will be connecting these up to our backend, but we're stopping here so everyone has time to absorb and tinker.  Next stop will be connecting them, which means auth (finally!)
