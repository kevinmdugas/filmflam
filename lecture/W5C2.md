Let's finally try something fresh and new, client only.  Lets change the name when you click on the sentence.

```ts
function renderApp(state) {
  return `<p onClick="changeName()">Hi from ${state.name}</p>`;
}
```

So now we've put what looks like a function name into a string.  What precisely is this doing?  In essence, we've run into another thing, like `document` that's new in the browser.  We also have access to an object `global` which is exactly what it sounds like.  It is an object available across our entire client.  This also includes our HTML pages, unlike most anything else.

If you've encountered Singletons before, it is like a singleton.  It carries all the same terrible flaws as any singleton, but we'll use it now for convenience.  We can attach a function to this `global` object, then use it ANYWHERE in our code.  We're then calling that function from `onClick`.  These are known as `Events`.

### WARNING - VITE does not provide this by default!

```ts
window.global ||= window;

const state = {
	name: "Doggr",
};

global.changeName = () => {
	state.name = "Catte";	
};

function renderApp(state) {
	return `<p onClick="changeName()">Hi from ${state.name}</p>`;
}

function render() {
	const html = renderApp(state);
	if (document.body) {
		document.body.innerHTML = html;
	}
}

render();

```

Now lets run it and see if it works.  We get...nothing

Lets see if we can debug what's going on with a quick console.log

```ts
global.changeName = () => {
  state.name = "Catte";
  console.log("Name changed successfully");
};
```

So now we know we're running this code!  Why does it not change anything?

Well, we're calling a function that changes the `state.name` variable, but nothing's being rerendered, right?  We never call `render()` again after that name is changed.

```ts
global.changeName = () => {
  state.name = "Catte";
  console.log("Name changed successfully");
  render();
};
```

Next, lets add a counter rather than just a string.

```ts
const state = {
  name: "Doggr",
  count: 0,
};

global.changeCount = () => {
  state.count += 1;  
  render();
};

function renderApp(state) {
  return `<p onClick="changeCount()">You've clicked ${state.count} times</p>`;
}
```

Excellent, dynamic web code!

Let's now talk about why we've separated things between `render` and `renderApp`.  One of these is a `Pure` function, and one has side effects.  Pure functions will always do exactly the same thing given the same input, whereas impure ones may not!

> [!Note]
> Our `renderApp` function is pure, because given a specific `state` argument, it will always perform identically
> Our `render` function is not, because it changes our innerHTML as a side effect

Why do we care?  Pure functions are easy to test and verify!  The more of our code we can restrict to these pure functions, the better.  What could be easier to test than something you provide specific input to (called `Mocking`) and are guaranteed to get the same result from every time?  

We keep our impure functions as limited and small as possible.  Notice `render` is only 2 lines of code.  This is much easier to manually verify than an entire codebase.

---
---

Lets try writing a test for it!  We'll start an `index.test.ts` in its own fancy `__tests__` folder, just because we can.

```ts
import { renderApp } from "./main";

it("Should render state into view", () => {
  let html = renderApp({ counter: 11 });
  expect(html).toEqual(`<p onClick="changeCount()">You've clicked 11 times</p>`);
});
```

Hrm, why didn't that work?  AH we've accidentally typo'd `count` as `counter`.   Easy fix:

```ts
it("Should render state into view", () => {
  let html = renderApp({ count: 11 });
  expect(html).toEqual(`<p onClick="changeCount()">Doggr clicked 11 times</p>`);
});
```

We've not yet typed State!  Lets go give it one, in a `src/types` subdir.

```ts
export type State = {
  name: string,
  count: number,
};
```

And update our index.ts to tell TypeScript to expect exactly that State everywhere:

```ts
import { State } from "./types/State";

let state: State = {
  name: "Doggr",
  count: 0,
};

...
export function renderApp(state: State) {
  return `<p onClick="changeCount()">You've clicked ${state.count} times</p>`;
}

export function render(state: State) {
  let html = renderApp(state);
  if (document.body) {
    document.body.innerHTML = html;
  }
}

render(state);
```

Now if we check our main.test file again, TYPESCRIPT HAS SAVED US!  Although this particular bug wasn't too terrible, TS can do this same thing with a HUGE variety of ways, provided you use it.

We have a new problem, however.  This one also makes sense, as we've forgotten to add the `name` property to our object we give to `renderApp` in the test.  Once again, TS has saved us, and we can quickly find a final working test:

```ts
//index.ts
export function renderApp(state: State) {
  return `<p onClick="changeCount()">${state.name} clicked ${state.count} times</p>`;
}
```

```ts
it("Should render state into view", () => {
  let html = renderApp({ count: 11, name: "DoggrName" });
  expect(html).toEqual(`<p onClick="changeCount()">DoggrName clicked 11 times</p>`);
});
```

Testing is a go!  Typescript is a go!

Code organization time.  We'll move our renderApp to an App.ts file and update our tests to match.  You'll notice we've now moved our Pure functions to App, and our impures stay here.  This makes testing saner.  What else could we do better?

We already don't like that `global` because there's nothing more dangerous in all of CS than globally mutable shared state (RUST), plus if we're expecting our site to become large, the `global` will get bloated and unwieldy.  We can do better, but for now, lets condense all of our functions into a single eventHandlers object and focus on one problem at a time. 

```ts
let eventHandlers = {
  increaseCount: (oldState) => {
    console.log("Counting");
    return { ...oldState, count: oldState + 1 };
  },
};

global.changeCount = () => {
  state = eventHandlers.increaseCount(state);
  render(state);
};
```

Why did we write the return in that manner?  Once again, we want to strive to maintain as much Pureness as we can.  By taking a specific input and producing a *NEW* specific output, we've made increaseCount pure.  We only want to change a single new property at a time using this method, so we can use our old `spread` operator to copy the old state, then set a single updated property.

Now that increaseCount is pure, is changeCount?  Why not?  `state =` is a side effect!  Notice how increaseCount does NOT modify the old state!  It ONLY returns a new one!  

What next?  Well, lets add a second one:

```ts
let eventHandlers = {
  increaseCount: (oldState) => {
    console.log("Counting");
    return { ...oldState, count: oldState.count + 1 };
  },
  decreaseCount: (oldState) => {
    console.log("Counting");
    return { ...oldState, count: oldState.count - 1 };
  },
};

global.increaseCount = () => {
  state = eventHandlers.increaseCount(state);
  render(state);
};

global.decreaseCount = () => {
  state = eventHandlers.decreaseCount(state);
  render(state);
};
```

Well, now we have pure event handlers, but this global is only doubling our work.

What if we made a single `emitEvent` on global instead?

```ts
global.emitEvent = (eventName) => {
  let eventHandler = eventHandlers[eventName];
  if (eventHandler) {
    state = eventHandler(state);
  }
  render(state);
};
```

We'll need to call this from `renderApp` too

```ts
export function renderApp(state: State) {
  let name = state.name;
  console.log(name);
  return `<p onClick="emitEvent('increaseCount')">${name} clicked ${state.count} times</p>`;
}
```

And update test to match:

```ts
it("Should render state into view", () => {
  let html = renderApp({ count: 11, name: "DoggrName" });
  expect(html).toEqual(`<p onClick="emitEvent('increaseCount')">DoggrName clicked 11 times</p>`);
});
```

---

This is nice and all, but nobody wants to click text.  We need to, say, give them a button.  Maybe even two buttons!

```ts
export function renderApp(state: State) {
  let name = state.name;
  console.log(name);
  return `<p>${name} clicked ${state.count} times</p>
  <button onClick="emitEvent('decreaseCount')">Decrease</button>  
  <button onClick="emitEvent('increaseCount')">Increase</button>    
  `;
}
```

Notice how easy it is to change and develop our html view.  All of our UI code is hanging out in App, while all of our logic lives elsewhere in components, waiting to be used.  This also makes it easy to update our test again to match, as we can just copy paste:

```ts
it("Should render state into view", () => {
  let html = renderApp({ count: 11, name: "Doggr" });
  expect(html).toEqual(`<p>Doggr clicked 11 times</p>
  <button onClick="emitEvent('decreaseCount')">Decrease</button>  
  <button onClick="emitEvent('increaseCount')">Increase</button>    
  `);
});
```
