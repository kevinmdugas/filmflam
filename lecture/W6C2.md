Instead, React will provide a handy-dandy place to put our async things, as well as any other functions that need to be re-executed ONLY WHEN some condition occurs.

This is what it looks like: 
```ts
const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);  
  
useEffect( () => {

		const getUsers = async () => {
			const usersRes = await axios.get("http://localhost:8080/users");
			return usersRes.data;
		};

		getUsers().then(setUsers);
	}, []);
```

This will run the effect function on page load, then NEVER AGAIN because `[]`.  Once it's done awaiting, it will call setUsers() from our state hook to update, which we use to render.  This makes our full code:

```ts
export const Users = () => {   
 const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);  
  
 useEffect(() => {  
  const getUsers = async () => {  
   const users = await axios.get(  
    "http://localhost:8080/users"  
   );  
   setUsers(users.data);  
  };  
  void getUsers();  
 }, []);  
  
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Users:</h2>
			{    users ?
				<ul>{users.map((user: {email: string, name: string}) => <li key={user.email.toString()}>{user.name} - {user.email}</li>)}</ul>
				: null
			}
		</div>
	);
```

- [ ] Now we'll also need to add CORS plugin to Fastify....this one is unpleasant, to say the least:
``` 
await app.register(cors, {  
origin: (origin, cb) => {  
cb(null, true);  
}  
});
```

Finally we see information from our backend in the browser!  

### Our first trip is done.

Things to ponder:  
- What if MULTIPLE components need that same piece of state? 
- How in the world are we going to keep track of which components need to render and which don't? 

Lets set up basic "View profile, match or don't match, view another profile" loop.  This means our frontend needs a concept of overall "State".  We'll create a types subdir `/src/types/DoggrTypes.ts` and `initialState.ts`

```ts
export type State = {  
 currentProfile: ProfileType,  
 likeHistory: Array<ProfileType>,  
 passHistory: Array<ProfileType>,  
};  
  
export type ProfileType = {  
 imgUri: string,  
 thumbUri: string,  
 name: string,  
 id: number,  
}
```

```ts
  
import { State, ProfileType } from "./types/DoggrTypes";  
  
const initialState: { likeHistory: ProfileType[]; currentProfile: ProfileType } = {  
 currentProfile: getRandomProfile(),  
 likeHistory: [getRandomProfile(), getRandomProfile()],  
};  
  
export default initialState;  
  
export function getRandomProfile(): ProfileType {  
 const idNum = Math.random() * 10000;  
  
 return {  
  imgUri: `https://loremflickr.com/300/300/animal?lock=${idNum}`,  
  thumbUri: `https://loremflickr.com/75/75/animal?lock=${idNum}`,  
  name: `Doggr${idNum}`,  
  id: idNum,  
 };  
}
```

To make use of this, we're going to first alter the current App.tsx to change the "Converter" to Match, likethe following:

```ts
import './App.css'  
import { Link, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';  
import Home from './components/Home';  
import Match from './components/Match';  
  
function App() {
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<nav>
				<div className="menu">
					<Link to="/">Home</Link>
					<Link to="/match">Match</Link>
				</div>
			</nav>
			<Routes>
				{" "}
				<Route path="/match" element={<Match />} />
				<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
			</Routes>
		</div>
	);
}
  
export default App
```

-- Then run rename refactor on components/Converter to Match.  We'll come back to match in a second, but first we'll finish up Home.tsx, which was already provided for us!  You can probably already see what this code does, but we're creating navigation between "pages".  

This is built into react in the form of react-router-dom and is what people mean when they say `Single Page App` -- we don't actually show any different pages at all, here!  We have just our ONE html file that does nothing but hook up React, then load our React App!  We thus must simulate what users "expect" using a router on our frontend too, JUST like the backend!  

https://reactrouter.com/en/main (We're using BrowserRouter from main.tsx)

** Now, inside of Home.tsx, we can create a little landing page:
```ts
export default function Home() {  
    return (<div>  
        <h1>Doggr</h1>  
        <h3>Where your pets finds love(tm)</h3>  
  
      </div>    );  
  }
```

Just to emphasize composability, lets convert this into multiple Components:

```ts
export default function Home() {  
    return (<div>  
        <Title />          <Subtitle />  
      </div>    );  
  }  
  
export function Title() {  
    return(<h1>Doggr</h1>)  
}  
  
export function Subtitle() {  
    return(<h3>Where your pets find love(tm)</h3>)  
}
```
