Before we go any further, lets separate some of these components.  It's getting messy.  There are MANY styles or paradigms about how this should be done.  We're going to use one of the most common, which is that you are only allowed ONE "Stateful" component per file.  Multiple stateless (Pure!) components may share a file.

- [ ] This one is popular enough an eslint rule already exists: https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-multi-comp.md#ignorestateless

Now we're ready to move back to showing a Match list of profiles!  Lets add a Components subdir, then add Match.tsx and Profile.tsx
v
In backend, our state comes from our database connection.  In frontend, we don't have (direct) access, so we have to manage our own.  We've already seen simple useState() above, but what happens if we want to access the same piece of State from more than one component?

This is where our second React concept comes from.  It piggybacks on html properties and allows you to pass State/data/ EVEN FUNCTIONS from a parent component to subcomponents!  So ANY time you need to share state, some upper parent component will be the one to useState() create and "own" it.  We're going to make a Profile Component that accepts some of its state from a parent:

```ts
import {useEffect} from "react";  
  
export type ProfileProps = {  
 id: number,  
 imgUri: string,  
 name: string,  
 onLikeButtonClick: () => void,  
 onPassButtonClick: () => void,  
}  
  
export function Profile(props: ProfileProps) {  
 const { imgUri, name, onLikeButtonClick, onPassButtonClick } = props;  
  
 useEffect(() => {  
  console.log("Profile rerendered");  
 });  
  
 return (  
  <div>  
   <img src={imgUri} alt="Profile of pet"/>  
   <h2>{name}</h2>  
   <div>    <button onClick={onPassButtonClick}>Pass</button>  
    <button onClick={onLikeButtonClick}>Like</button>  
   </div>  </div> );  
}
```

Now lets see the flipside where we utilize it before we talk about them together:

We're going to head to Match.tsx and add the following:

```ts
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import initialState, { getRandomProfile } from "../InitialState";
import { Profile } from "./Profile";
import { Title } from "./Home";

function Match() {
	const [currentProfile, setCurrentProfile] = useState(initialState.currentProfile);
	const [likeHistory, setLikeHistory] = useState(initialState.likeHistory);

	useEffect(() => {
		console.log("-- App rerenders --");
	});

	const onLikeButtonClick = () => {
		// this keeps allocations and copies to a minimum
		const newLikeHistory = [...likeHistory, currentProfile];
		const newProfile = getRandomProfile();
		setCurrentProfile(newProfile);
		setLikeHistory(newLikeHistory);
	};

	const onPassButtonClick = () => {
		const newCurrentProfile = getRandomProfile();
		setCurrentProfile(newCurrentProfile);
	};

	const profile = (
		<Profile
			{...currentProfile}
			onLikeButtonClick={onLikeButtonClick}
			onPassButtonClick={onPassButtonClick}
		/>
	);

	return (
		<>
			<Title /> {profile}
		</>
	);
}

export default Match;

```

And we're now a multiple "page" SPA!  The next step will be connecting these up to our backend, but we're stopping here so everyone has time to absorb and tinker.  Next stop will be connecting them, which means auth (finally!)

## AUTH STARTS HERE

We're going to mostly build our own, which as I said, is a horrible idea!  We're still going to do our best and use industry-standard things.  Everyone will supply an email address and password to log in, and we will return them a special string called a JWT or Json Web Token

- [ ] JWT, which you can find info at https://jwt.io is a rather simple device.  It's just a single long string divided into 3 portions by `.`s  These portions include a Header, a Payload, and a Signature.

Header: This contains token type (JWT for us) and which encryption algorithm is used to sign the hash (RSA/ SHA256/Etc).  This is then Base64 encoded.

Payload: This is our actual specific user data.  We're using user_ids for this, which are also Base64 encoded

Signature: This is a cryptographic signature, such as with public/private key pairs.  It encrypts the header + payload to verify they've not been changed in-route

Luckily, we don't have to worry about most of this, as we'll use the JWT package to manage the token formation.

- [ ] Note that this is ENTIRELY separate from storing a password itself.  Thus we will also need to encrypt the password itself while transmitting it from user to our server.  For this, we'll use industry-standard bcrypt: https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-in-action-understanding-bcrypt/

- [ ] Thus our overall flow is this:
1) User creates account and enters password in the create screen
2) Frontend bcrypts that password, then sends the bcrypted password to our server.  Because of SSL, we can trust this transmission and deposit that password into our database
3) User attempts to login by entering password
4) Again we bcrypt and send to our server.  Our server retrieves pw from database and checks it against what the user sent using a special bcrypt comparison
5) Our server creates a JWT token that represents the successful login and sends it back to the client
6) The client then sends only that JWT in subsequent requests, NEVER their password again.  Thanks to the magic of JWT, this is PERFECTLY SECURE and allows our server to validate that login WITHOUT querying our database or hitting the third party API again


### Now lets get started - Installing new backend packages:
`pnpm i jsonwebtoken bcrypt @fastify/jwt @fastify/cors` 
`pnpm i -D @types/bcrypt @types/jsonwebtoken`

We'll also need to add a new field to our users table to store encrypted passwords.
- Fix up seeding
	- user_seeder.ts
		- `user.password = await hash("password", 10);`

- pnpm migration:freshSeed

Now we need a few routes!  

- [ ] Our Create User needs to hash the entered password from frontend.  Note that we don't need to encrypt the transmission itself because SSL will already be doing that, and if SSL is broken, the world is in trouble.
```ts
import bcrypt, { compare as bcryptCompare, hashSync } from "bcrypt";
...

	app.post<{ Body: ICreateUsersBody }>("/users", async (req, reply) => {
		const { name, email, password, petType } = req.body;

		try {
			const hashedPw = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
			const newUser = await req.em.create(User, {
				name,
				email,
				password: hashedPw,
				petType,
				// We'll only create Admins manually!
				role: UserRole.USER
			});

			await req.em.flush();
			return reply.send(newUser);
		} catch (err) {
			return reply.status(500)
				.send({ message: err.message });
		}
	});

```

Up next, we need a login route.  Remember though that we want to use JWT tokens, which means we need to set those up!  Luckily we can make another Fastify plugin, like our Database plugin, to take care of this for us.

> In plugins/auth.ts

```ts
import dotenv from "dotenv";  
dotenv.config();
import {FastifyInstance, FastifyPluginOptions, FastifyReply, FastifyRequest} from "fastify";  
import Jwt, {VerifyPayloadType} from "@fastify/jwt";  
import fp from "fastify-plugin";  
  
  
declare module 'fastify' {  
  interface FastifyRequest {  
   // You can easily find the type of this return using intellisense inferral below  
    jwtVerify(): Promise<VerifyPayloadType>  
  }  
 interface FastifyInstance {  
  auth(): void,  
 }  
}  
    
export const AuthPlugin = fp(async function(fastify: FastifyInstance, opts: FastifyPluginOptions) {  
 fastify.register(import("@fastify/jwt"), {  
  secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET 
 });  
  
 fastify.decorate("auth", async function(request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) {  
  try {  
   // This is the thing we added in our interface above  
   await request.jwtVerify();  
  } catch (err) {  
   reply.send(err);  
  }  
 });  
});
```

- [ ] Add to .env/dockerfile/docker-compose
- [ ] Add registration to app.ts `await app.register(AuthPlugin);`

Now we're ready to add our login route!
```ts
import {compare as bcryptCompare, hashSync} from "bcrypt";
....
	app.post<{
		Body: {
			email: string,
			password: string,
		}
	}>("/login", async (req, reply) => {
		const { email, password } = req.body;

		try {
			const theUser = await req.em.findOneOrFail(User, {email}, { strict: true });

			const hashCompare = await bcryptCompare(password, theUser.password);
			if (hashCompare) {
				const userId = theUser.id;
				const token = app.jwt.sign({ userId });

				reply.send({ token });
			} else {
				app.log.info(`Password validation failed -- ${password} vs ${theUser.password}`);
				reply.status(401)
					.send("Incorrect Password");
			}
		} catch (err) {
			reply.status(500)
				.send(err);
		}
	});
```

We can check in Postman now!

Once you get a token back in Postman from "/login", copy paste it into Postman's Authorization tab directly as "Bearer Token".  Now we can protect a route, say, GET /users, with our auth!

```ts
// Route that returns all users who ARE NOT SOFT DELETED
	app.get("/users",
		{ onRequest: [app.auth] },
		async (req, reply) => {
		try {
			const theUser = await req.em.find(User, {});
			reply.send(theUser);
		} catch (err) {
			reply.status(500)
				.send(err);
		}
	});
```

Presto, now we get megabooted if we don't have a token!  Backend auth DONE!
